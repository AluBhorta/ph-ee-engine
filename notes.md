# troubleshooting notes

## session 2

- changes i made to resolve previous errors
  - remove old helm chart installation
  - upgrade kubectl version from 1.18 to 1.27 (matching server version)
  - install needed helm repos
  - update image tags from latest to specific versions as in docker hub
  - replace `keycloak` service to enable the one with mounted volume
- latest errors
  - pod `ph-ee-connector-gsma-abc-def` → `configmap "ph-ee-config" not found`
  - pod `ph-ee-importer-rdbms-abc-def` → `configmap "ph-ee-config" not found`
  - pod `ph-ee-operations-app-abc-def` → `configmap "ph-ee-config" not found`
  - pod `ph-ee-kibana-abc-def` → `secret "elastic-certificate-pem" not found`
  - pod `ph-ee-elasticsearch-0` → `secret "elastic-certificates" not found`
  - pod `ph-ee-importer-es-599869544f-m9xfz` → `secret "elastic-credentials" not found`
  - pod `zeebe-operate-68d9fb8794-vhbrn` → error in logs say a lot including "Couldn't connect to Elasticsearch"
- suggestions for solving current issues
  - find out how the missing secrets and configmaps are supposed to be created. ensure they are created properly
  - note down any config/deployment changes you make for making troubleshooting easier
  - try tweaking `values.yaml`
  - watch the k8s events to find issues
    ```bash
    kubectl get events -w
    ```

## session 1

- [official installation instructions](https://github.com/openMF/mifos-documentation/blob/d0dca451bdf138da09f726bee99712db6dcfff7e/payment-hub-ee/overview/installation-instructions.md)
  or alternatively https://mifos.gitbook.io/docs/payment-hub-ee/overview/installation-instructions
  NOTE: installation doesn’t work as expected
- ❌ using ph-ee-labs
  ```bash
  cd ph-ee-env-labs/helm/payment-hub-med

  helm repo add ph-ee-engine https://fynarfin.io/images

  # note the changes made in Chart.yaml
  helm dep build

  helm install phee-med .
  # isn't working...
  ```
- ❌ directly installing chart
  ```bash
  helm install phee https://fynarfin.io/images/ph-ee-engine-5.0.1-SNAPSHOT/ph-ee-engine-5.0.1-SNAPSHOT.tgz
  ```
  error i’m getting now
  ```bash
  coalesce.go:220: warning: cannot overwrite table with non table for ph-ee-engine.operations_web.deployment.config (map[])
  coalesce.go:220: warning: cannot overwrite table with non table for ph-ee-engine.operations_web.deployment.config (map[])

  ```
- ✅ modifying a downloaded chart
  following are steps i took:
  - download and extract [ph-ee-engine-5.0.1-SNAPSHOT.tgz](https://fynarfin.io/images/ph-ee-engine-5.0.1-SNAPSHOT/ph-ee-engine-5.0.1-SNAPSHOT.tgz)
    or another version from [this registry](https://fynarfin.io/images/)
    ```bash
    curl -O https://fynarfin.io/images/ph-ee-engine-5.0.1-SNAPSHOT/ph-ee-engine-5.0.1-SNAPSHOT.tgz
    tar xvzf ph-ee-engine-5.0.1-SNAPSHOT.tgz
    ```
  - install chart
    - resolve initial errors of install
      - change all `PodDisruptionBudget` `apiVersion` from `policy/v1beta1` to `policy/v1`
      - install CRD for service monitor
        ```bash
        k apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_servicemonitors.yaml
        ```
    ```bash
    helm install phee .
    ```
  - troubleshoot errors
    - image pull errors from private ecr repo: 419830066942
      solution: either build your own images for the needed services, or find already built ones available on public registries.
      - following are some users with some public ph-ee images on docker-hub
        - https://hub.docker.com/u/lalithkota
        - https://hub.docker.com/u/shanidkh
        - https://hub.docker.com/u/danishfynarfin
        - https://hub.docker.com/u/tunexio
  - my lastest update
    - I’ve replaced the enabled service images from _`419830066942.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`_ to images [this user’s images](https://hub.docker.com/u/lalithkota).
    - the helm chart now gets installed successfully, but all the components don’t run on my environment due to limited resources like ram and storage.
    - i'm adding the minimum setup instructions on [setup.md](./setup.md) and these notes on [notes.md](./notes.md).
    - i can certainly help troubleshoot further issues for this project and help your team operate k8s effectively. let me know what's next in priority.
  - prospective next steps
    - install the chart on a k8s cluster with enough resources ie. cpu, mem, storage.
    - only enable the phee components that are needed in `values.yaml`. set the others to `enabled: false`. this will help reduce the complexity and get the project going faster.
    - (optional)
      - adjust `values.yaml` according to needs
      - try other versions of the chart
      - build and use your own images
